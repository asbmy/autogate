How Does it Work:

*It will blink green when the gate is opening until it is completely open which will remain green until main switch is off
*If the gate is closing it will blink red until it completely closed which will remain red until main switch is off
*In case of object detection, the gate will pause until the object is gone, current operation will resume
*If gate is completely open and main switch is turned off, when it turns on again it will close the gate
*If gate is completely closed and main switch is turned off, when it turns on again it will open the gate
